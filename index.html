<h1>Hello! I'm Max Kulakov

<p>At the moment I am a product designer in two start-up projects,
    I live in Saratov and I am a third year student at SSU,
    at the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology.</p>
<p>I have been actively designing since 2018. Started as a count.
    the designer and over time realized that the topic of interfaces and the product,
    in general, was of much more interest, so in the spring of 2019 he decided
    to expand his specialization and cover a new area. During this time,
    I managed to participate in several projects, such as: Venrok sports app,
    Lifetables habits tracker and Easy-traveling travel selection.
    In parallel, he worked with various companies on visual and identity issues
    and managed to implement cases for three events of Youcon Events Group,
    Jedi.university University, SSU CSIT, Vladimir Novikov's Personal Dentistry Center,
    LoyalMed loyalty service and beyond.</p>
<h1>A little more details
    <br>about the products</h1>
<p>He began his journey into product design with the easy-traveling project,
    started at the hackathon, the service allowed him to choose a weekend trip
    to any part of Russia for a specified budget. The work on the project consisted
    of fully thinking through the functionality and visuals from scratch
    and how the user will interact with the service, what will be a priority
    for him and what result he will have to get for choosing a trip, interacting
    with the schedule already during the trip and upon returning home,
    system of bonuses and feedback. One of the tour operators planned to join the project,
    but, alas, everything ended at the stage of discussing mutual integration,
    and the team decided to take a break in development.</p>
<p>The Venrok sports app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/il/app/venrok-workouts/id1479561440">
    apps.apple.com/il/app/venrok-workouts/id1479561440</a>)
    was the first serious project in terms of length and complexity.
    Joined the development team after they released the first release of the application,
    created purely by their forces, then they realized the lack of a designer in the team.
    Venrok positions itself as a sports app for professional athletes and, unlike competitors,
    allows you to customize your workout in detail in the most detailed details.
    To the basic interface, which included a list of workouts and exercises, and a basic player,
    onboards were added, advanced registration, a subscription model, functional customization
    for each exercise, constants, synchronization with google fit and apple health, profile extension,
    and application customization, bundles and programs, with the ability to create them for coaches,
    a feed and a user tracking system, the creation of a community in a sports area of ​​interest,
    advanced statistics with the display of many parameters, including a visual display of the muscles
    involved in the training process. In addition, he was engaged in the design of the page for the stores,
    updating the identity, thinking through the creatives for advertising campaigns, researching
    with real people to identify gaps in the user experience and improving the interface.
    At the moment, this project is already about two years old and work on it continues.</p>
<p>The next project was the Lifetables habit tracker
    (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lifetables-motivation-habits/id1527590620">
        apps.apple.com/us/app/lifetables-motivation-habits/id1527590620</a>).
    People are interested in observing the statistics of their lives and mentally relaxing
    at the sight of what path they have taken, therefore, together with one of the developers
    of the previous project, a new application was created. Unlike Venrok, my work on this project
    was carried out from the very beginning, and I went from drawing a user flow in a notebook
    and conducting tests on real people with prototypes to the first release and then adding
    and fixing functions. The work on the project continues now.</p>
